## Things I should be able to do in less than 10 mins (and with little sweat)
- merge sort
- quick sort (done)
- insert sort
- linked list (done)
- tree traversals
- balance a tree
- tries
- write a BST
- graphs dfs bfs
- heap (doen)

- have written down the time complexity of main data structures and algo
- implement from scratch a hashtable
- write a balanced tree

## General notes
- Do not implement a Heap as a tree, always use an array, as per https://favtutor.com/blogs/heap-in-python
- When implementing a linked list simply create a Node class and a few functions to operate on the nodes
- Do not try to be smart, solve a problem in a simple obvious way
