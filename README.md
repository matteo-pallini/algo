## Practice problems

## Worth knowing
- merge sort
- quick sort
- insert sort
- linked list
- tree traversals
- balance a tree
- tries
- write a BST
- graphs dfs bfs
- heap

- time complexity of main data structures and algo
- implement from scratch a hashtable

## General notes
- Do not implement a Heap as a tree, always use an array, as per https://favtutor.com/blogs/heap-in-python
- When implementing a linked list simply create a Node class and a few functions to operate on the nodes
- Do not try to be smart, solve a problem in a simple obvious way
